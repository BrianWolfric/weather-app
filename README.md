##  Weather App
### An Obligatory Weather App

This is a weather app made using the OpenWeatherMap API and jQuery. Animations were created using HTML5 Canvas. Icons are from Noun Project.

I wanted to spend some time learning/using jQuery and HTML5 Canvas. This is basically my first app, so there's a lot of room for improvement.

**Feel free to use this code, but please create your own API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) so it doesn't get blocked from overuse. Thank you.**
